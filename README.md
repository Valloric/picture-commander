Picture Commander
=================

This is a quickly hacked together webapp that makes it possible to click an
image in a gallery in one browser tab and have that image automatically
server-pushed (via [Server-Sent Events]) and displayed in a different tab.
Subsequent image clicks in the gallery replace the displayed image in the
viewer tab.

Super-useful when projecting one browser tab to a different screen with say a
[Chromecast][] since the gallery tab can then control the projected one.

There's one "admin" view (`/gallery` handler) and one "display" view (`/viewer`
handler). Provide a path to an image folder on server startup. The server will
recursively collect all images in that folder hierarchy.

You can also have multiple viewer devices/browsers connected at the same time
and they'll all be updated.

Install the server dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Python
2.7 required.

How to run the server:

```shell
./server.py --images_folder=./test_images --port=8080 --host=localhost
```

Then go to <http://localhost:8080/gallery> for the admin view and to
<http://localhost:8080/viewer> for the viewer page.

Tested with latest Chrome, Firefox and Safari across desktop, Nexus 5/7/9
and iPad. For the love of god, don't expose this server to the Internet.
